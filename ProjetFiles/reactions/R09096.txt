ENTRY       R09096                      Reaction
NAME        acetyl-CoA decarbonylase / synthase (ACDS)
DEFINITION  Acetyl-CoA + H+ + 5,6,7,8-Tetrahydromethanopterin <=> 5-Methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + CO + CoA
EQUATION    C00024 + C00080 + C01217 <=> C04488 + C00237 + C00010
COMMENT     Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) from Methanosarcina thermophila is a multifunctional enzyme, part of a five-subunit complex.
            This enzyme complex catalyzes the reversible oxidation of Carbon monoxide to Carbon dioxide. 
            It also catalyzes the cleavage (or synthesis) of acetyl-CoA to (or from) methyltetrahydromethanopterin, carbon monoxide, and Coenzyme A.
