ENTRY       R05189                      Reaction
NAME        acyl-CoA:methylmalonyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (decarboxylating, oxoacyl- and enoyl-reducing)
DEFINITION  Acyl-CoA + n Methylmalonyl-CoA + 2n NADPH + 2n H+ + Acyl-carrier protein <=> Multi-methyl-branched acyl-[acp] + (n+1) CoA + n CO2 + 2n NADP+ + n H2O
EQUATION    C00040 + n C02557 + 2n C00005 + 2n C00080 + C00229 <=> C21392 + (n+1) C00010 + n C00011 + 2n C00006 + n C00001
COMMENT     Acy-carrier protein is acp domain of the enzyme itself.
