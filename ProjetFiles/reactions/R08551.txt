ENTRY       R08551                      Reaction
NAME        cytochrome P-450 reductase
DEFINITION  [Oxidized NADPH---hemoprotein reductase] + NADPH + H+ <=> [Reduced NADPH---hemoprotein reductase] + NADP+
EQUATION    C03161 + C00005 + C00080 <=> C03024 + C00006
COMMENT     NADPH---hemoprotein reductase is this enzyme itself.
            The reduced enzyme serves as electron-donor for heme-containing enzymes (ex. cytochrome P-450;ec 1.14.14.1)
